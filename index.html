         Dear Adhore, I want you to closely get your attention to this.I can't say for sure what happened as i am just an indirect message. But you may feel better to listen. First of all, Let your tears fall. Don't conjust it in your heart. It worth it. Take a break from the things that are hurting you. It could be bad relationship with family or someone disrespecting you in such ways to make you uncomfortable. We make mistakes. There could be some situation you may face where you see you are wrong. You could have done better. But you are not the villain my friend. Don't try to lean on others. It is very hard to trust anyone even sometimes yourself. The best thing to do is MOVE ON. What happened is past. What matters is now because thats way you are here reading this. Never forget you can correct your mistakes but not solve them. So imbrace it and live again like a true warrior. Sounds like I see you right in front of you. Helping you by my side. That's what friends do exactly. I myself have faced this. But no way our situation is same. As the things that harden you are the only one you can solve not mine.
         
         
         
         
         
         
       </p>
       <p class="pp1">I have sometimes felt like going away. From the world where nothing goes my way and I am treated as nothing.But thats not true all of us have someone that we love. You have someone as well. Don't you? If not you are wrong. Go through phone and open gallary. See who is there the most. Yourself . That's someone you shall love the most.
         <br>Sorry i sound like an old gramps.<br> Hope it helped a bit.</p>
